                <h3>Your Privacy Matters</h3>
                <p>
                    Kido Cloud is built from the ground up with you in mind and our goal is to protect your privacy in everything we do.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Except as expressly provided in this Privacy Policy, we won't share or sell your personal information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Except as expressly provided in this Privacy Policy, we won't reveal your identity or share or sell your personal information (including your email) with anyone without your permission.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We will use data anonymously to improve our services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We collect information along the way to improve our services, like cookies, usage data, etc. but that will not be connected to any of your personal information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We will get your permission to email you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We will get your permission to send you emails about new features, helpful tips, or information about products that may be of interest to you. For any of these non-service-related emails, you can change your mind and stop receiving them at any time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We always tell you the reasons we're collecting information.
                </p>

                <h3>CONTACT DETAILS</h3>
                <p>
                    We use your email address to create your account and to send service-related emails (reset password, notifications, etc.). We will never provide your email to another company and you can decide if you want to receive non-service-related emails from us. Parent personal information, including contact details will be visible to school staff for all schools that have them registered as parents or guardians.

                <p>

                </p>
                <br>

                <h3>MEDIA CONTENT</h3>
                <p>
                    School's media content, including images and videos, uploaded by school staff, are only shared with parents and staff registered under the same school account. No media content is used for marketing purposes or shared with third party companies.
