                </p>
                <h3>Location Usage for the App</h3>
                <p>Our app utilizes location services to provide parents with real-time updates on the location of their children when they are on the bus traveling to and from kindergarten. This feature ensures parents have peace of mind and can track their child’s transit for added safety.</p>
                <h3>Details of Location Usage:</h3>
                <p><b>Purpose:</b> The app uses the location data of the child’s device (or a designated tracking device) to show real-time updates on their journey.</p>
                <p><b>Functionality:</b> Location data is used solely for tracking purposes while the child is in transit and is visible only to authorized parents or guardians.</p>
                <p><b>Safety Assurance:</b> This feature helps parents stay informed and ensures that children reach their destination safely.</p>

                <h3>Privacy Policy Explanation</h3>
                <p>We take the privacy and security of your data very seriously. Here’s how we handle location information:</p>
                <p>
                  <b>Information We Collect:</b> We collect real-time location data from the child’s device when the bus route begins and ends. This data is only active during transit times and is not continuously tracked outside of these periods.

                <h4>How We Use Your Data:</h4>
                <p>
                  <b>Tracking:</b> To allow parents or guardians to monitor their child’s journey for safety purposes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>Notifications:</b> To send alerts or updates about the bus’s status and estimated arrival times.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>Data Sharing:</b> The location data is shared exclusively with authorized users (e.g., parents or guardians) through secure in-app access. We do not share location data with third-party advertisers or external parties.
