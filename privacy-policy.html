                  <p style="margin-left: 20px">
                    Yes, keeping your data secure is one of our top priorities. We use a replication system that automatically mirrors your data across selected regions, enhancing both availability and protection against data loss.

                  <p style="margin-left: 20px">
                    Replication occurs every 24 hours and ensures your data is served from the region closest to the requesting CDN PoP (Point of Presence). This setup not only increases data reliability but also significantly improves performance for uncached requests.

                    In compliance with GDPR, Kido Cloud will securely delete or destroy all personal data within a reasonable timeframe after the school requests its removal.

                <h3>Location Usage for the App</h3>
                <p>Our app utilizes location services to provide parents with real-time updates on the location of their children when they are on the bus traveling to and from kindergarten. This feature ensures parents have peace of mind and can track their child’s transit for added safety.</p>
                <h3>Details of Location Usage:</h3>
                <p><b>Purpose:</b> The app uses the location data of the driver’s device (or a designated tracking device) to show real-time updates on their journey.</p>
                <p><b>Functionality:</b> Location data is used solely for tracking purposes while the school bus is in transit and is visible only to authorized parents or guardians.</p>
                <p><b>Safety Assurance:</b> This feature helps parents stay informed and ensures that children reach their destination safely.</p>

                  <b>Notifications:</b> To send alerts or updates about the bus’s location.
